# Fixed: Vercel Deployment Issues

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Mixed Content Error (HTTPS/HTTP)
**Problem**: ScraperAPI was using HTTP, causing mixed content errors on HTTPS Vercel deployment
**Fix**: Changed `http://api.scraperapi.com` to `https://api.scraperapi.com`

### 2. Serper API 400 Errors  
**Problem**: "Query not allowed" errors from Serper.dev API
**Fix**: 
- Added proper error handling for API response errors
- Reduced request limits from 20 to 10 results
- Added fallback mock data when API fails
- Fixed environment variable name mismatch

### 3. App Crashes on API Failures
**Problem**: App would crash when APIs returned errors
**Fix**: Added comprehensive fallback mock data for all services

## Environment Variables for Vercel

Set these in your Vercel project settings → Environment Variables:

```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCqfGVn2en65rHww2xxf5Kmwsp_2ivudy4
VITE_SCRAPER_API_KEY=b1707ff5b84a130c0a4b32297cdb6329
VITE_SERPER_DEV_API_KEY=db27bc40780be37033b34edf4c263677bcc1bf74
VITE_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=AIzaSyA_1V8DSlI7d85n6cQ8mpUOoYWvomZp_Yw
```

## What Changed in Code:
1. **ScraperAPI**: Now uses HTTPS endpoint
2. **Error Handling**: All API calls now have proper error handling with fallback data
3. **Rate Limiting**: Reduced API request volumes to prevent quota issues
4. **Mock Data**: Added comprehensive mock data methods for offline functionality

## Next Steps:
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard  
3. Redeploy your application
4. Test the app - it should now work without mixed content errors

The app will now gracefully handle API failures and provide mock data when needed, ensuring it always works even if external APIs are down.
