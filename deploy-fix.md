# Quick Deployment Fix

## The Issue
You're still seeing the old version because the changes haven't been deployed to Vercel yet. The console errors show the old HTTP ScraperAPI calls.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix mixed content errors and API error handling"
git push
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Vercel
Go to your Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables:

```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCqfGVn2en65rHww2xxf5Kmwsp_2ivudy4
VITE_SCRAPER_API_KEY=b1707ff5b84a130c0a4b32297cdb6329
VITE_SERPER_DEV_API_KEY=db27bc40780be37033b34edf4c263677bcc1bf74
VITE_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=AIzaSyA_1V8DSlI7d85n6cQ8mpUOoYWvomZp_Yw
```

### 3. Force Redeploy
- Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments
- Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
- Or push another commit to trigger auto-deployment

## What's Fixed:
✅ ScraperAPI now uses HTTPS (no more mixed content errors)
✅ Better error handling - no more "Failed to load content data"
✅ Mock data fallbacks when APIs fail
✅ Fixed environment variable names

## Expected Result:
- No more mixed content errors in console
- Content audit will show mock data if APIs fail
- App won't crash on API errors
- Smooth user experience even with API issues

The changes are ready in your code - you just need to deploy them!
